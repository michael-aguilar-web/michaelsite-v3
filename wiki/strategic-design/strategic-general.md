## michael's giga list of strategic design do or dies aka the driver biased golden rules

#### 0. general takes
  - strategic design should be incredibly driver biased
    - if the driver has to play operation to **pick up** a game piece it's not fun
    - if the driver has to play operation to **place** a game piece it's not fun
    - the driver should be able to "drive it like they stole it" and not be afraid of breaking it
      - low cg
    - if you can't get a week of drive practice minimum you are designing more than you can handle
      - drive practice is everything
      - if your robot can't perform as it was designed to do, you aren't playing the game
  - but overall elite strategic design is simple: make a robot that wins 99% of your matches in auton
    - a robot purpose built to win auton usually has all the bells and whistles a driver should want
    - winning in auton means the rest of the match is relaxed
    - Teams that design to perform well in auton usually place high
      - lots of simple strategic design micro you can do to make ur robot better in auton: what intake side vs outtake side, how you hold the piece, how many motions it takes for the robot to score, etc
  - chase constant improvements no matter how little
      - A lot of the mid-tier-but-could-be-great teams have a lot of things that are like 6-8/10 on their robot but could be 10/10 with a little work
      - That being said don’t make changes unless they are well tested
      - The season is a marathon not a race
  - leave **nothing** to chance, control everything within your resources / capabilities

### 1. driver setup
  - one driver only, always, no exceptions
    - if your robot requires 2 drivers it's probably too complicated
    - you should have the programming resources to automate whatever robot you build to be able to fit it on one controller 
    - operator controller is fine for debug / backup stuff but the robot should be able to be driven off the main controller in most cases; in some games you really want a second human player instead
  - 4 year drivers
    - example: parker
  - hot take: when choosing a driver, choose the kid with the biggest ego
    - the best drivers have the biggest egos
    - the people who perform best under pressure are usually a little insane
    - the kids that pick up the controllers the fastest are usually the ones that care the most
  - swerve
    - that is all

### 2. intakes
  - if it don't suck, it sucks
    - if you can't consistently manipulate the game piece you aren't playing the game
    - your robot needs a wide intake that actually works, the intake is everything
    - it shouldn't just suck, it should abduct -> bean's competitive advantage in 26 was the fact that the intake inhaled pieces off the field even when the robot was driving full speed
  - wide(asterisk) intakes that actually work, the intake is everything
    - doesn't necessarily have to be super wide if u always pick up from hp in specific conditions, but generally good (2910 2023 vs most 2017 designs)
      - in both contexts though the same takeaway is lowering driver precision, wide intakes in 2023 would hit on the double sub, whereas wide intakes in 2017 made it easier to drop the gear
    - 2024, our intake is wide enough to make it easier for the driver, but also narrow enough to not be able to accidentally intake 2 at once
  - the robot should be able to slam into the hp station to load pieces, don't make it do any whacky alignment

### 3. pick n' place rules
  - it's called pick and place, not pick and shoot, pick and lob, pick and drop
    - baits: 2025 coral shooters, 2019 ball shooters, 2023 cone shooters, etc
    - this is usually because of the precision required

### 4. software
  - frc is now a software game: https://youtu.be/vGajw5-vbo8?si=zi4d7QjN0jgQmHaw 
    - However the foundation is set with mechanical robustness
    - Good software can make a decent mechanical robot great
      - a simple mechanical robot with complex software is lightweight
      - Modern frc software allows you to get away with very simple architectures that would have been incredibly troll a decade ago
        - Simple architecture means it’s done faster which means it can be programmed earlier
    - The advent of April tags means a lot of actions that were once driver skill checks are now just programming automation skill checks
